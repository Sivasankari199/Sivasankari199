# 👋 Hello Reader, I am a self-assured individual and Machine Learning Engineer

I approach every project with confidence and curiosity, designing and deploying smart systems that deliver measurable value. My strengths include recommender systems, robust data pipelines, practical deployment, and communicating technical solutions for business impact.

## 🚀 What I Do

- **Recommendation Systems:**  
  Built hybrid engines (deep learning + FAISS + LightGBM/reranking) for grocery, music, and loyalty platforms.
- **Applied Machine Learning:**  
  Extensive work in classification, regression, ranking, and simulation, using real and synthetic data pipelines.
- **End-to-End Development:**  
  Everything from data wrangling and feature engineering to model training, deployment (Streamlit, Flask), and demo notebooks.
- **APIs & Integration:**  
  RESTful APIs with Flask/FastAPI, LangChain-powered QA bots, interactive web UIs for user-facing and team delivery.
